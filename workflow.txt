1. Workflow: The Standardized Resume Builder
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows the student to input personal and professional details into a structured multi-step form, visualize the result in real-time, and export a university-standardized PDF resume.
Workflow Description:

Step-by-Step Navigation:
The user navigates to the "Student Dashboard" and clicks the "Edit Profile / Build Resume" button.
The user is taken to a multi-step form page. They enter details into specific sections: Personal Info, Education, Skills, and Projects.
As the user types, they see a "Live Preview" pane on the right side of the screen, which dynamically updates to show how the final document will look.
The user clicks the "Save Profile" button. The system validates the inputs (e.g., checking for empty required fields) and saves the data to the database.
Once saved, the user clicks the "Export as PDF" button. The system generates and downloads the file to the user’s device in the official university format.

Key Features & Functionalities:
Multi-Step Form Wizard: Breaks long data entry into manageable chunks (Step 1, Step 2, etc.).
Live Preview Component: A React component that renders the JSON data into a document layout instantly.
Data Validation: Prevents users from submitting incomplete profiles.
PDF Generation: Backend utility to convert the HTML/React view into a downloadable PDF.






2. Workflow: The Job Application Cycle
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows students to browse job listings using filters, apply with a single click using their stored profile, and track the status of their application from "Applied" to "Shortlisted" or "Rejected."

Workflow Description:

Step-by-Step Navigation:
The user navigates to the "Job Board" page.
The user interacts with the Search and Filter bar, selecting criteria such as "Job Type" (Internship/Full-time) or "Department" (CS/BBA) to narrow down the list.
The user clicks on a specific Job Card to view the full Job Description and requirements.
The user clicks the "Apply Now" button. The system automatically retrieves their saved profile (from Workflow 1) and submits it to the recruiter.
The user is redirected to the "My Applications" page, where they see the new application listed with an "Applied" status badge.
(Recruiter Side): The recruiter views the applicant list and changes the status. The student refreshes their dashboard to see the badge update to "Shortlisted" (Green) or "Rejected" (Red).

Key Features & Functionalities:
Advanced Filtering: sorting jobs by category, salary range, or posting date.
One-Click Apply: Removes the need to re-upload documents for every application.
Application History: A dedicated view for students to track all past and current applications.
Dynamic Status Badges: Visual indicators that change color based on the application state.




3. Workflow: The Time-Bound Interview Cycle
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows a recruiter to schedule an interview which triggers a 24-hour countdown; the student must confirm within this window to finalize the slot, otherwise, the system auto-cancels the meeting.
Workflow Description:


Step-by-Step Navigation:

The Recruiter navigates to the "Shortlisted Candidates" view and clicks "Schedule Interview."

The Recruiter selects a Date and Time and sends the request.

The Student receives a notification and sees the interview in their "Interviews" tab with a status of "Pending Confirmation" and a visible countdown timer.

Scenario A (Success): The student logs in and clicks the "Confirm" button before the timer hits zero. The status changes to "Confirmed," and the "Join Meeting" button is scheduled to appear 15 minutes before the call.

Scenario B (Timeout): If the student does not click confirm within 24 hours, the system automatically runs a check, updates the status to "Cancelled," and disables the confirmation button.


Key Features & Functionalities:

Expiration Logic: Backend check (or Cron job) that compares the current time with the request timestamp.

Countdown UI: Visual representation of the remaining time for the student.

Conditional Button Rendering: The "Confirm" button is only clickable if the request is active; the "Join" button only appears after confirmation.

Automated Notifications: System alerts for both parties when a status changes (Confirmed or Cancelled).
