1. Workflow: The Standardized Resume Builder
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows the student to input personal and professional details into a structured multi-step form, visualize the result in real-time, and export a university-standardized PDF resume.
Workflow Description:

Step-by-Step Navigation:
The user navigates to the "Student Dashboard" and clicks the "Edit Profile / Build Resume" button.
The user is taken to a multi-step form page. They enter details into specific sections: Personal Info, Education, Skills, and Projects.
As the user types, they see a "Live Preview" pane on the right side of the screen, which dynamically updates to show how the final document will look.
The user clicks the "Save Profile" button. The system validates the inputs (e.g., checking for empty required fields) and saves the data to the database.
Once saved, the user clicks the "Export as PDF" button. The system generates and downloads the file to the user’s device in the official university format.

Key Features & Functionalities:
Multi-Step Form Wizard: Breaks long data entry into manageable chunks (Step 1, Step 2, etc.).
Live Preview Component: A React component that renders the JSON data into a document layout instantly.
Data Validation: Prevents users from submitting incomplete profiles.
PDF Generation: Backend utility to convert the HTML/React view into a downloadable PDF.






2. Workflow: The Job Application Cycle

3. Workflow: The Time-Bound Interview Cycle
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows a recruiter to schedule an interview which triggers a 24-hour countdown; the student must confirm within this window to finalize the slot, otherwise, the system auto-cancels the meeting.
