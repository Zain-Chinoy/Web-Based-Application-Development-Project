2. Workflow: The Job Application Cycle
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows students to browse job listings using filters, apply with a single click using their stored profile, and track the status of their application from "Applied" to "Shortlisted" or "Rejected."

Workflow Description:

Step-by-Step Navigation:
The user navigates to the "Job Board" page.
The user interacts with the Search and Filter bar, selecting criteria such as "Job Type" (Internship/Full-time) or "Department" (CS/BBA) to narrow down the list.
The user clicks on a specific Job Card to view the full Job Description and requirements.
The user clicks the "Apply Now" button. The system automatically retrieves their saved profile (from Workflow 1) and submits it to the recruiter.
The user is redirected to the "My Applications" page, where they see the new application listed with an "Applied" status badge.
(Recruiter Side): The recruiter views the applicant list and changes the status. The student refreshes their dashboard to see the badge update to "Shortlisted" (Green) or "Rejected" (Red).

Key Features & Functionalities:
Advanced Filtering: sorting jobs by category, salary range, or posting date.
One-Click Apply: Removes the need to re-upload documents for every application.
Application History: A dedicated view for students to track all past and current applications.
Dynamic Status Badges: Visual indicators that change color based on the application state.




3. Workflow: The Time-Bound Interview Cycle
Workflow Specification: The workflow allows a recruiter to schedule an interview which triggers a 24-hour countdown; the student must confirm within this window to finalize the slot, otherwise, the system auto-cancels the meeting.
